Description: 
  This package implements Cross-Validated Kernel Ensemble (CVEK), 
  a flexible modeling framework for robust nonlinear regression and 
  hypothesis testing based on ensemble learning with kernel-ridge estimators.
  It allows user to conduct nonlinear regression with minimal assumption on 
  the function form by aggregating nonlinear models generated from a diverse 
  collection of kernel families. It also provides utilities to test for the 
  estimated nonlinear effect under this ensemble estimator, using either the 
  asymptotic or the bootstrap version of a generalized score test.
